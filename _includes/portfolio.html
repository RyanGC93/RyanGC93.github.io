    Welcome to my online portfolio, a blend of technology and creativity
    showcasing my work with stunning dynamism. Using Three.js, Gulp, Sass, and
    Jekyll, this site is a pinnacle of modern web design and development
    efficiency.

    Three.js enhances the portfolio with interactive 3D experiences, bringing
    projects to life through engaging animations and detailed models. Gulp
    automates crucial tasks like script minification and image optimization,
    streamlining updates and maintenance. Sass revolutionizes CSS management
    with its robust features, enabling intricate yet clean styling. Finally,
    Jekyll provides the backbone, offering simple content management and
    templating ideal for frequent updates, all while ensuring easy deployment
    via GitHub Pages for seamless access.
